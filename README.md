# Shopping API

API that expose features to collaborate on shopping lists.

## Concepts

* **Group** is a concept that is not managed directly in this app. It is a unique identifier that should be generated by client apps. Ideally it should be prefixed by client app name to avoid collisions.
* **CartItem** represent the amount of an item that has been picked and is in current shopping cart.
* **CheckListItem** represents the amount of an item that we should buy.
* **CheckListBatch** is an organizational unit that may be used to manage together a bunch of CheckListItem. (it can be useful if one needs to rescale batch items as a whole)
